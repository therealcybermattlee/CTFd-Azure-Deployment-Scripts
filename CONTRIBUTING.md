2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Make your changes

## Development Guidelines

### Script Standards

- **Bash version**: Target Bash 4.0+ compatibility
- **Error handling**: Always use `set -e` and proper error checking
- **Logging**: Use the `log()` function for consistent output
- **Colors**: Use defined color variables (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, NC)
- **Functions**: Create reusable functions for complex operations
- **Comments**: Document complex logic and Azure-specific fixes

### Testing Requirements

Before submitting PRs, test on:
1. Fresh Azure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS VM
2. Fresh Azure Ubuntu 24.04 LTS VM
3. VM with existing Docker installation
4. VM after running uninstall script

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests

Example:
```
Fix Docker group creation on Azure VMs

- Add check for existing docker group
- Create group before Docker installation
- Handle systemd daemon reload properly

Fixes #123
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Document any new Azure-specific requirements
- Add troubleshooting steps for new error scenarios
- Include examples for new functionality

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Clean installation works on fresh VM
- [ ] Upgrade from previous installation works
- [ ] Uninstall removes all components correctly
- [ ] Docker starts properly after reboot
- [ ] SSL certificate obtains successfully
- [ ] All management scripts function correctly
- [ ] Error handling works for common failures
